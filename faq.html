					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">What is a password strategy?</a>
						<p class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js"> A password strategy is a mental algorithm that you can use to generate your passwords on the fly, i.e., you don't need to memorize passwords anymore! Whenever you need to type a password you can simply run an algorithm in your head with no need for paper or pencil. Click on <a href="three-word.html">Three Word Strategy</a> to see an example of such a strategy.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">Why should I use a password strategy?</a>
						<p class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js">If all your accounts have the same password, the adversary that knows the password to your facebook account can also login to your bank account. Using password strategies, you generate a unique password for each website. It does greatly increase your security. And you do not have to memorize or write down any of your passwords.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">Do I need to memorize passwords for different websites?</a>
						<p class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js">No! Everytime that you want to login to a website, you will generate/regenerate your password using your password strategy, i.e., mental algorithm.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">What if I don't use a website for a few months? Will I still remember the password?</a>
						<p class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js">You don't have to remember your password, you can easily regenerate it in your head.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">If I want to adopt a password strategy, I would have to change all of my current passwords, this is a lot of effort! Why should I do this?</a>
						<div class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js">The initial effort to adopt our password strategies might seem high. However, you don't need to change all your passwords in one shot, you can change the password for a website the next time you want to login to the website. Once you adopt it for your accounts, it will make your life much easier for the following reasons: 
							<ul>
								<li>You don't need to remember any of your passwords.</li>
								<li>Your passwords will resemble a random combination of letters/numbers and therefore will be very hard to crack.</li>
								<li>You don't even need to know if you have an account with a website! Generate your password with your algorithm, if it works, you have an account, otherwise create an account with the same password that you just generated.
								</li>
								<li>If you want to make a new account, you don't need to design a new password. Just give the name of the website/app as input to your algorithm and generate a password.
								</li>
								<li>No "forgot my password" anymore!</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">These strategies are public, why are my passwords secure?</a>
						<p class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js">Although the strategies are public, your mental algorithm uses a private key that only you know. It is a mathematically proven fact that if you chose your key randomly (not based on your personal information), your passwords will be hard to crack.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">How difficult is it for an adversary to hack into my accounts?</a>
						<p class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js">It depends on the strategy that you use. For example, if you use the <a href="three-word.html">Three Word Strategy</a> , the adversary would need to steal approximately five of your passwords to be able to guess your password for a new website.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">Can I make my own password strategy?</a>
						<p class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js">Yes! You can customize any of the password strategies that we propose to fit your own preferences. Furthermore, you can make your own password strategy from scratch.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="faq-accordion__item accordion-item-js">
						<a class="faq-accordion__question accordion-btn-js">How should I use these strategies if the website name contains numbers or special characters?</a>
						<p class="faq-accordion__answer accordion-contant-js">You can set your own rules for handling these cases. For example, you can either skip the non-letter characters or assign all of them to a fixed letter or number (similar to wild card).</p>
